# PyPocketMiner

PyPocketMiner is a fork of the excellent [PocketMiner](https://github.com/Mickdub/gvp/tree/pocket_pred) tool, refactored for use as a python library.

PocketMiner is a tool for predicting the locations of cryptic pockets from single protein structures.

PocketMiner is built using the architecture first published in [Learning from Protein Structure with Geometric Vector Perceptrons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01411) by B Jing, S Eismann, P Suriana, RJL Townshend, and RO Dror.
